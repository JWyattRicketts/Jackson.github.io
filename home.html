        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Jackson Ricketts. I am an undergraduate senior at the University of Tennessee at 
            Chattanooga pursuing a B.S. in physics. I graduate in May of 2024, and I am currently looking 
            to jump-start my career upon earning my degree. I am particulary interested in aerospace and
            defense manufacturing. Academically, I have been a consistent member of my college's Dean's List
            and am currently a student at the UTC Honors College. Within my major, I was the vice president
            of the UTC Chapter of the Society of Physics Students during the 2021-2022 school year, and I am a
            recipient of three physics merit awards. More practically, I have conducted research in fundamental
            neutron physics and astrophysics at UTC, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of 
            CÃ¡diz and have presented this research at several regional and national conferences. I will be available
            to work starting in June of 2024. Though I am currently based in Chattanooga, Tennesee, I am more than
            willing to relocate.
